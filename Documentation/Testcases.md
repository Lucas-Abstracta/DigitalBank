Test cases:

Log-in:

I decided to code the following test cases:

1 - "Should access to homepage with correct username and password"
    Here I used the credentials provided to us and checked if the system let us access the homepage.

2 - "Should redirect to homepage when accessing login page with a "remember me" option"
    We access the system like the test before but also clicking the "Remember me" checkbox to try to test if this saves the current session.

3 - "Shouldnt access with incorrect username and password"
    We use wrong data to try to access the homepage 

4 - "Should show an error message"
    We leave the inputs in blank

Log-out:

Here we test if the logout button works as intended in a normal session and if we checked the "Remember me" checkbox.
